            <p id="p-javascript">Javascript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion.</p>

            <p id="p-operators">Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages. The definition of an operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.

            <p id="p-variables">JavaScript has two scopes: global and local. A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout your program. A variable that is declared inside a function definition is local.</p>

            <p id="p-vnm">JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that a variable name such as myCounter is different from the variable name MYCounter. ... The first character must be an ASCII letter (either uppercase or lowercase), a letter that complies with Unicode variable naming conventions, or an underscore (_) character.</p>
